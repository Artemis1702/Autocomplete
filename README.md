# Autocomplete

Autocomplete, or word completion, is a feature in which an application predicts the rest of a word a user is typing. 

## Objective

We are coming up with our own autocomplete algorithm inspired by the existing different algorithms ,We will mainly be using the Tries data structure for this package, We will be doing autocomplete as well as word suggestions as the user keeps typing letters. As we keep feeding data the algorithm will keep getting better and better. We will modify the tries data structure a bit and add more functionalities to it.
